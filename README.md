fNotes is a simple open-source program for text processing.
It features a simple taskbar and a small settings menu.

The entire project is still W.I.P and is just a fun project I've been working on.
With fNotes I tried my best to make a light-weight text processor that uses barely any resources and is therefore rather quick.

**Here are a few images to show what fNotes looks like in its current version.**
